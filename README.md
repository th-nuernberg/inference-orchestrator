# ML Service Management with Nginx and Flask

This repository contains a Docker setup for managing Machine Learning (ML) services using Nginx and Flask. The setup orchestrates ML services on a Slurm system, ensuring they are started, stopped, and managed efficiently.

## Overview

The system comprises a Docker container running Nginx and Flask. Nginx acts as a reverse proxy, routing incoming ML service requests to Flask. Flask, in turn, manages the ML services on the Slurm system.

## Features

- **Dynamic ML Service Management**: Flask dynamically starts, stops, and monitors ML services based on incoming requests.
- **Timeout Handling**: Each ML service is assigned a predefined timeout. Requests to the service reset the timeout timer, ensuring services remain active as long as they're in use.
- **Slurm Integration**: ML services are managed on a Slurm system, leveraging SSH tunnels for communication and control.
- **Scalability**: The setup can handle multiple concurrent ML service requests efficiently.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ml-service-management

    Start Docker Containers:

    bash

    docker-compose up -d

    Access Services:
        Nginx: Access Nginx server at http://localhost.
        Flask: Flask app is available within the Docker container.

    Usage:
        Send ML service requests to Nginx, which forwards them to Flask for handling.
        Flask manages the ML services, starting or stopping them as needed.
        Monitor the system for efficient ML service management.

Configuration

    docker-compose.yaml: Contains the Docker configuration for Nginx and Flask containers.
    Flask App: Implement ML service management logic within the Flask application.
